# trinket-ng
#### We-pwn-izing the Adafruit Trinket M0 for fun and profit.(but mostly for some people I work with :space_invader: )


### HID/Keystroke injection
##### Use it to automate a task across air gapped devices, or to *remind* someone to lock thier workstation.
1. To run the example, replace the content of the main.py file on the board with [this](https://github.com/librarysteve/trinket-ng/blob/master/main.py)
2. Edit the peyload variables to your liking (or leave it as is)
3. Save and be ready for that paylod to run. It will run immediately.

Suggested editors are: 
* mu
https://codewith.mu/ (this intigrates with the board and will give you errors in the serial console)

* notepad
* nano (Linux/OSX)
* vim (if you hate life)
* emacs (if youre a wizzard)

#### Note:
you will need to extract the [HID library](https://github.com/librarysteve/trinket-ng/raw/master/adafruit_hid.zip) in the lib folder (if there is no lib folder create one)
