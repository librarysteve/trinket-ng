#### We-pwn-izing the Adafruit Trinket M0 for fun and profit.(but mostly for some people I work with :space_invader: )


### HID/Keystroke injection
##### Use it to automate a task across air gapped devices, or to *remind* someone to lock thier workstation.
1. To run the example, add the code to the main.py file
2. Edit the peyload variables to your liking (or leave it as is)
3. Save and be ready for that paylod to run. It will run immediately.

Suggested editors are: 
* mu
https://codewith.mu/

* notepad
* nano (Linux/OSX)
* vim (if you hate life)
* emacs (if youre a wizard)

#### Note:
you will need to extract the HID library in the lib folder (if there is no lib folder create one)
