# trinket-ng
#### We-pwn-izing the Adafruit Trinket M0 for fun and profit.(but mostly for some people I work with :space_invader: )


### HID/Keystroke injection
##### Use it to automate a task across air gapped devices, or to *remind* someone to lock thier workstation.
1. To run the example, replace the content of the main.py file on the board with [this](https://github.com/librarysteve/trinket-ng/blob/master/main.py)
2. Edit the peyload variables to your liking (or leave it as is)
3. Save and be ready for that paylod to run. It will run immediately.
4. Wait.

Suggested editors are: 
* mu
https://codewith.mu/ (this intigrates with the board and will give you errors in the serial console)

* notepad
* nano (Linux/OSX)
* vim (if you hate life)
* emacs (if youre a wizzard)

#### Note:
you will need to extract the [HID library](https://github.com/librarysteve/trinket-ng/raw/master/adafruit_hid.zip) in the lib folder (if there is no lib folder create one)
