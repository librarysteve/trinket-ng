# trinket-ng
#### We-pwn-izing the Adafruit Trinket M0 for fun and profit.(but mostly for some people I work with :space_invader: )


### HID/Keystroke injection
##### Use it to automate a task across air gapped devices, or to *remind* someone to lock thier workstation.
1. To run the example, add the code to the main.py file
2. Edit the peyload variables to your liking
3. Save and be ready for that paylod to run when you next plug the trinket in.

#### Note:
you will need the hid library in the lib folder (if there is no lib folder create one)
